                                <p>
                                    Just because you're into fashion, doesn't mean you have to have a lot of clothes. Having a couple versatile clothing items that fit your taste is a great way to ease yourself into dressing better. Soft grunge, in particular, often reuses the same pieces to make different looks.

                                    Even though they're at the bottom of your outfit, shoes are often the star of the show. In soft grunge fashion especially, shoes can make an outfit. Chunky, tall, or platform shoes can pull a look together.
