                                  <figcaption>Just a couple clothing items, like a black mini skirt, can be reused and mixed and matched to make so many different outfits.</figcaption>

                                <p>Some people may consider grunge style to be old-fashioned. However, we know that is not true. Even though, the original idea comes from the 90s the modern fashion hasn’t left the style out. These days there are many grunge outfits to be spotted on the streets. That is why, if you want to embrace your inner rebel we suggest you pay attention to this fresh grunge compilation. By adding these clothing items to your closet, you can tap into the soft grunge style.</p>

                                <p>The little black skirt has been a closet staple for me for as long as I can remember. Right now, I have four of them. They’re versatile, figure-flattering pieces, so I often reach for them when I’m getting dressed in a hurry (i.e. always). The skirt can also be worn in any weather—throw on a tank or oversized t-shirt button up in warmer weather, or layer with tights and a big sweater.</p>

                                <figure>
                                    <img src="staple-items-2.jpg" alt="Person sitting wearing all black">
                                    <figcaption>Black clothing is so versatile.</figcaption>
                                </figure>

                                <p>About a year ago, I realized that I feel most comfortable, the most myself, when I wear black, grey, and other dark colors. Looking at my closet, there are maybe two items that are brighter, purchased mostly because I felt (and was told) that I needed more color in my wardrobe. For some reason, it felt like it was wrong to wear black-on-black or black-on-grey five or six days out of the week. I’ve since changed my stance. While I do have a lot of (dark) red in my wardrobe, too, it’s not unusual for me to wear just black or grey. And I love it. There are good, practical reasons for having lots of black in your wardrobe. It's so versatile!</p>

                                <p>Another item you need is a leather jacket—although we encourage you to buy vegan leather. Some types of jackets are limited strictly for formal or casual occasions. A suit jacket, for instance, is the most formal type of outerwear and should only be worn for such occasions. A leather jacket, however, offers a higher level of versatility, allowing you to wear it for either casual or formal occasions. You can wear it when running errands around town, dining out with friends, or attending an important meeting with coworkers. This versatility is something you wont’ find in other jackets or outerwear. So, if you want a jacket that you can wear for both casual and formal occasions, stick with leather and avoid other materials..</p>

                                <p>Layering clothing is a useful skill in fashion, and getting the right clothing can help you do that. Up until recently, my knowledge of how to layer clothes in such a way that was both functional and fashionable was limited. As far as I was concerned, piling on various knit and fleece-lined items was a means of survival in frigid weather conditions, not a fashion statement. Imagine my surprise when it finally dawned on me that I could be warm and look cute, too.</p>
